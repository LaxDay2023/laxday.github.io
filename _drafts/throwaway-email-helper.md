I am a big advocate of online privacy; I don’t like giving away any more personal information than is strictly necessary, and it pains me to see my friends and family blindly entering their real names and email address into random online forms, merely because a website is asking them to do so, without really comprehending what they're doing. Once your personal information’s out there it’s almost practically impossible to take it back.

Even if you decided to live under a rock wearing a tin foil hat, as soon as you sign up for a phone/internet/utility contract, or even simply pay your council tax, your details are out there, on the web, somewhere. Hopefully encrypted, hidden and protected. Likely not as well as you’d hope or imagine. It’s not reasonable to expect that your information not be in any online database, but it’s prudent to minimise this potential exposure.

potential The best idea is to simply not put it out there in the first place by not using any online services and living under a rock with a tin foil hat on. Unfortunately that’s not entirely conducive to modern life, so a more realistic alternative is to simply not put your real details into anywhere that’s not strictly necessary.

You’re not going to be able to avoid using your real details everywhere... banks, mobile phone contracts, utilities etc are more than likely going to require real information. There are a lot of places on the internet that really don’t need your real name and email address. All they need it for is to market to you and sell it onto other companies. Even if you like and trust the website your entering your data into, there’s no guarantee that they won’t sell your data, or simply leak/lose your data inadvertently. It happens everyday.

Anyway... one of the normal parts of a registration process for an online service is email address verification. You fill in your email address, they send you an email with a link, you click on the link, et voila... you’ve proven that you “own” that email address. Email addresses are one of the main pieces of information that companies use to track you around the internet. Generally, most people only have one personal email address, and maybe a second one for work. It takes effort to set up a new email address and most people can’t really be bothered to set up a different email account for every different online service because... well that’s just mental.

Enter throwaway email accounts. Throwaway/temporary/disposable/anonymous email accounts are simply email addresses and inboxes that you can use to sign up for those services that you don’t want to enter your real information into. You don’t have to sign up/sign in... you can simply view the inbox. There are plenty of them about, but two of my favourites are mailinator and maildrop. These services allow you to see the emails sent to any email address you like on the mailinator.com or maildrop.cc domains. I like this method of anonymous email compared to services like 10minutemail, where an inbox is setup for you upon request.

The slight issue with this style of inbox, mailinator particularly, is that you have to come up with your own email address username. Think one up out of the blue. It’s actually not that easy. Certainly not after 5 or 10 accounts. Humans aren’t very good at being random, so you’ll sometimes end up using the same email address multiple times, or randomly pick the same as someone else. Remember, half the point of this is to prevent the trackers from tracking you. There’s no point in using the same disposable email account on multiple sites... then it just becomes your regular email address. A regular email address with absolutely no security.

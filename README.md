This is the code for my blog: [erresen.github.io](https://erresen.github.io)

It was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). Help with Jekyll on GitHub Pages can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/).

To run the code locally and preview drafts, follow the installation instructions from the [GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/) and run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts
``` 

Any code pushed to the master branch will be automatically published to the live blog.

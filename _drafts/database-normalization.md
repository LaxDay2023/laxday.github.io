Database normalization involves structuring your database in a way that reduces duplicated/redundant data and improving data integrity. There are six levels of database normalization; first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), forth normal form (4NF), fifth normal form (5NF) and sixth normal form (6NF), each of which build upon the previous level - a database can't be in third normal form if it isn't also in first and second. The higher the level, the better the data integrity and safety.

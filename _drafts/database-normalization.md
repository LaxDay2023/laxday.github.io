Database normalization involves structuring your database in a way that reduces duplicated/redundant data and improving data integrity. There are five levels of database normalization; first normal form (1NF), second normal form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), forth normal form (4NF) and fifth normal form (5NF), each of which build upon the previous level - a database can't be in third normal form if it isn't also in first and second. The higher the level, the better the data integrity and safety.
